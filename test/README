This directory is supposed to grow a set of mpg123 sanity checks.

Currently, there's something preliminary in the 1000Hz directory (used during gapless development) and some tools here that I use to compare mpg123 to the MPEG reference data:
	- converters bewteen raw sample formats (including that 24bit hex ASCII from the reference)
	- RMS error computation, including a verdict about conformity based on RMS and max error

I am still wondering if it's OK to redistribute the offical reference data here...

Oh, and there's forkfaint.c .. a check for an old bug with zombifiying the other end of a pipe with mpg123.
