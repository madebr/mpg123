/** \defgroup syn123_api syn123 library API
 *  With the need to present the generated signals with differing
 *  encodings for playback, the two-fold nature of this library
 *  emerges: Signal generation and encoding conversion. Both can be
 *  rather trivial indivdually, but become tedious when one wants
 *  to cover a certain range of options. So, here it is. This is
 *  not designed to be another full-fledged audio synthesis package.
 *  It is designed to be what one can use to get some test sound into
 *  (or out of) a program quickly without a big framework.
 *  I try to keep it small, adding gimmicks only if they have a high
 *  fun-to-code ratio (for me;-).
 *
 *  The usage model is this:
 *
 *  1. Create handle with desired output format.
 *  2. Set up synthesis mode with parameters.
 *  3. Repeatedly extract buffers with PCM samples.
 *
 *  The other functions for encoding conversion, (de-)interleaving,
 *  and interleaved mixing work without a handle and only use the
 *  buffers you hand in. Only the functions that are able to return
 *  a success code do check arguments for obvious trouble like
 *  NULL pointers. You are supposed to act responsibly when calling.
 *
 *  The size of buffers is either counted in bytes or samples, which,
 *  depending on the context, refer to individual PCM samples or to what is
 *  more strictly called a frame (one sample for each channel counted
 *  together).
 *
 *  So far, I am not considering fixed-point implementations. The main
 *  functionality of the generators can limit (emulated) floating-point
 *  work to the initial filling of the period buffer, with no computational
 *  overhead after that. The mixing code might benefit from a fixed-point
 *  variant on certain platforms, but I do not have such a platform at
 *  hand and do not feel the need.
