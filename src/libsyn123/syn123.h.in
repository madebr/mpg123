	syn123: some signal synthesis born out of out123

	copyright 2017-2018 by the mpg123 project,
	free software under the terms of the LGPL 2.1
	see COPYING and AUTHORS files in distribution or http://mpg123.org

	initially written by Thomas Orgis

	With the need to present the generated signals with differing
	encodings for playback, the two-fold nature of this library
	emerges: Signal generation and encoding conversion. Both can be
	rather trivial indivdually, but become tedious when one wants
	to cover a certain range of options. So, here it is. This is
	not designed to be another full-fledged audio synthesis package.
	It is designed to be what one can use to get some test sound into
	(or out of) a program quickly without a big framework.
	I try to keep it small, adding gimmicks only if they have a high
	fun-to-code ratio (for me;-).

 *  The usage model is this:
 *
 *  1. Create handle with desired output format.
 *  2. Set up synthesis mode with parameters.
 *  3. Repeatedly extract buffers with PCM samples.
 *
 *  Idea: configurable time shift and balance between channels,
 *  for stereo experiments. Simple for two. But for more? Well,
 *  an array of shifts and channel volume. Doesn't hurt if I 
 *  have the channel index in the outmost loop anyway.
 *
 *  The buffering of the oscillators in a table should be optional.
 *  For small freqs, it will be likely slower than just computing
 *  as the table is spilling out of the caches. I could get smart
 *  and try to mix the approaches. Really slow oscillations (usually
 *  a pulse/shot/gaussian) could be applied to the existing buffer.
 *  But this is just toying around ...
