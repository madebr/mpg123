/* API TODO:
	- rename audio_output_t to out123_handle
	- ensure that mpg123_encsize() is not used when deciding not to rely on
	  libmpg123; easy enough to reimplement. Should not have been a function
	  from the beginning!
	- Consider zero-copy mode. Ideally, one asks the buffer process for
	  a memory block to write to and avoids any copying.
	  Only trouble is that a desired size might not fit in one piece into
	  the ringbuffer.
	  Same goes for audio driver backends, some might offer the buffers to
	  the client. But this is post-release of the first incarnation:
	  The library should exist and provide functionality first before
	  spending time on irrelevant optimizations.

/** \defgroup out123_api
 *  This is out123, a library focused on continuous playback of audio streams
 *  via various platform-specific output methods. It glosses over details of
 *  the native APIs to give an interface close to simply writing data to a
 *  file. There might be the option to tune details like buffer (period) sizes
 *  and the number of them on the device side in future, but the focus of the
 *  library is to ease the use case of just getting that raw audio data out
 *  there, without interruptions.
 *
 *  The basic idea is to create a handle with out123_new() and open a certain
 *  output device (using a certain driver module, possibly build-time defaults)
 *  with out123_open(). Now, you can query the output device for supported
 *  encodings for given rate and channel count with out123_get_encodings() and
 *  decide what to use for actually starting playback with out123_start().
 *
 *  Then, you just need to provide (interleaved pcm) data for playback with
 *  out123_play(), which will block when the device's buffers are full. You get
 *  your timing from that (instead of callbacks). If your program does the
 *  production of the audio data just a little bit faster than the playback,
 *  causing out123_play() to block ever so briefly, you're fine.
 *
 *  You stop playback with out123_stop(), or just close the device and driver
 *  via out123_close(), or even just decide to drop it all and do out123_del()
 *  right away when you're done.
 *
 *  There are other functions for specific needs, but the basic idea should be
 *  covered by the above.

/*
	This includes the mpg123 header, but does only use definitions from there,
	no symbols of the actual mpg123 library.
	Actually, I have to think about that. The string memory management could be
	useful for out123_drivers(), but somehow I feel we should get by without
	linking in an MPEG decoder library. Unless: Offer transparent decoding of
	MP3 directly to the output. Hm, then, WAV and friends should also be
	supported. This widens the scope of the library. Does it also actually
	increase the usefulness?

	Oh, and another point is that the string stuff is optional in libmpg123
	anyway. So, this option of transparently decoding things in the background
	is a separate point from easing the creation of strings with lists of
	driver modules.

	While it might be nice to have a very minimal program to play MPEG data,
	I think the purity of having the output library just deal with PCM data
	should not be given up lightly.

	A more sensible feature should be a WAV header parser to enable a client
	program to auto-configure output format.
